# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
-Get to know the data and how it can be used to create useful insights </br>
-Clean up the data so the insights are clear and concise </br>
-Confirm the data used for the insights is bug free and accurate </br>
-Display the relationships between the tables used </br>

## Process
-Load data into DB </br>
-Understand how the data works and how the tables relate </br>
-Clean the data </br>
-Answer the questions provided </br>
-QA the answers for bugs and inaccuracies </br>
-Determine other useful questions from the data </br>
-Repeat the clean, answer, QA process </br>

## Results
-First, what I thought I learned about the data from my initial dig in was all wrong. After going through the first 4 questions I had to go back because I realized that a couple columns were not what I originally thought they were. </br>
-I prematurely "cleaned" and regretably updated some tables, most of which was completely unnecessary. </br>
-After all of this, I learned that the data had some very rudimentary sales data with some more in depth web site traffic data. </br>
-I learned about where traffic was coming from, which products were selling, which cities and countries sales were being made to, how people were reaching the site, and what the conversion rate of visitors was. </br>

## Challenges 
-There is a lot of unhelpful data (ie - city = "not available in demo dataset" and analytics table is not confidentally joined to other tables) </br>
-Columns are very poorly named and there is A LOT of inconsistency in how things are named (ie - product names and product categories). </br>
-Also, how was it possible for so many people to place orders without giving a proper city name? </br>


## Future Goals
-I'd like to determine how more of the data relates, I struggled to find use of the analytics table specifically which felt wasteful </br>
-I wish I had shared the iterations of the queries and not just the end product, to better showcase the thought process </br>
